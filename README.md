Qt Grade Calculator

This is a grade calculator based on the classes I am currently taking, the UI is broken up into 3 sections. 
From top to bottom first the class is chose, this changes which parameters are taken into account and the grading scale.
Next is the middle section which lets users use either the slider or spin box to input their scores (from 0-100), on the assignments and midterms/papers/finals. Some are N/A'd out and are not taken into account during the grading calculations but still have functioning sliders and spinboxes.
And finally the calculation button displays their score out of 100 on the bottom right.
